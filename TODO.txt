===THE COKERWARE EXPERIENCE===

Same idea as WarioWare
Microgames (4-10 seconds per game)
Collections based on control method:
	Mouse (Click, drag, flick, hover, scroll)
	Keyboard (WASD, Space, enter)
	Controller (Control Sticks, trigger)
Inspirations:
	WarioWare Microgames
	Among Us Tasks

Mouse Microgames:

1. Click in order
	Circles from 1-X displayed
	Click on each in order
	Biggest circle first, smallest last
	Higher Levels: more numbers, sizes not in order
To program:
	Spawn circles of various sizes
	Make sure they dont touch/overlap
	Register clicks on them
	Give each circle a number
	Ensure proper order (1, 2, 3, 4)
	Indicate circle was clicked

2. Screw!
	Move the mouse clockwise to screw in the screw
	Higher Levels: Screw gets stuck (have to move on the outer edge of screen), unscrew, screw in multiple screws
To program:
    Convert mouse drag to angle
	Reject passing through center of screen
	    Show animation of screwdriver stripping if this happens
	Show screwing direction, hide on input
	Do camera transition to reveal fully built object

To program any microgame:
	- Timer
	- Win condition
	- Lose condition
	- transition
	- command
	- difficulty control

To Program hub:
	- scene transition
	- display score, lives, level, (speed?)
	- art (background, sprites, audio)
	- lose animation
	- share data between scenes
