===THE COKERWARE EXPERIENCE===

Same idea as WarioWare
Microgames (3-7 seconds per game)
Collections based on control method:
	Mouse (Click, drag, flick, hover, scroll)
	Keyboard (WASD, Space, enter)
	Controller (Control Sticks, trigger)
Inspirations:
	WarioWare Microgames
	Among Us Tasks

Mouse Microgames:

1. Click in order
	Circles from 1-X displayed
	Click on each in order
	Biggest circle first, smallest last
	Higher Levels: more numbers, sizes not in order
To program:
	Spawn circles of various sizes
	Make sure they dont touch/overlap
	Register clicks on them
	Give each circle a number
	Ensure proper order (1, 2, 3, 4)
	Indicate circle was clicked

To program any microgame:
	- Timer
	- Win condition
	- Lose condition
	- transition
	- command
	- difficulty control

To Program hub:
	- scene transition
	- display score, lives, level, (speed?)
	- art (background, sprites, audio)
	- lose animation
	- share data between scenes
